## Game rules

* Turn over any two cards.
* If the two cards match, they stay open.
* If they don't match, cards close.
* Remember what was on each card and where it was.
* Watch and remember during each move.
* The game is over when all the cards have been matched.
* The game displays a star rating (initial rating is 10 stars) that reflects the player's performance. After each 2 incorrect moves, player loses a star of rating.
